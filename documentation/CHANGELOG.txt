                                   Changelog

0.9.10

     * POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGE: Added Deny from All to the .htaccess for
       public_html pattern. If this breaks your compile, use a post
       compile hook to overwrite the default .htaccess file; see
       hooks/htaccess.sh for an example of how to do this. Be sure to
       register the hook file in core-config.sh in the post_hooks section,
       or it won't be called.

0.9

     * Removed support for kit templates. Now using Twig templates.
     * Lost iframe support; plans to bring it back in future.

0.8.18

     * Removed all traces of doxygene due to no plans for implementation.

0.8.10

     * API CHANGE: auto-generated.outline.json is now called
       outline.auto.json

0.8

     * BREAKING CHANGE: The paths in the config var README are now
       relative to the directory that contains core-config.sh, not the
       source folder.
